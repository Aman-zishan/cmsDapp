## Creating a Decentralized Airbnb DApp
### Intro
In this workshop, we'll explore how to create decentralized Airbnb. We will use the pre-written Ethereum smart contract and deploy it locally on ganache using remix, we can deploy contract on any Testnet or Mainnet .

This dApp uses [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), but is out of scope for this workshop, so don't worry, we will only be focusing on the pieces that helps us build. In practice, any JS framework can be used.


# Installation
## Check your environment
Prior to all, you should have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:
#### NodeJS 8.10+
```
node version
> 8.10+
```
If you need to update Node, please [install `nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) and install/use the LTS version. macOS/Linux commands provided for you below for convenience:
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash
nvm install --lts
nvm use lts
```
#### MetaMask

[Download MetaMask chrome extension](https://metamask.io/)


#### Install ganache-cli
```
npm install -g ganache-cli
```

# Template clone and explore
Now we have Setup installed properly, letâ€™s grab the dApp template that we will use as the skeleton of our dApp. This template is a website built using Nuxt.js (don't worry if you don't know Nuxt.js, we are not focusing on this part).

## We will...
We will use existing solidity contracts developed in previous session, and then use these functions inside the website.
[Airbnb.sol](./contracts/Airbnb.sol)

## Let's go

Clone the template into your folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/maticnetwork/ethindia-workshop.git

cd ethindia-workshop

npm i
```

## Start TestRPC for development using [ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli)

```
npm run test:ethereum
```

## Deploy contract using Remix Etherium IDE

- Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org)

- Enable `Solidity Compiler` and `Deploy & Run Transactions` on remix IDE

- Create new file [Airbnb.sol](./contracts/Airbnb.sol) from plus icon on left panel

- Select appropriate network on metamask, as we are going to deploy contract using ganache-cli we will select `Locahost 8545`

- Select appropriate compiler on remix IDE, in this example we are going to use `0.5.7` above compiler

- Go to DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS and click deploy.

- On sucessfull deploy copy `contract address`
